<div><small>18 July 2013</small></div>
<p>A Hackathon took place 1st and 2nd of July. The Hackathon word stands for “Hacking Marathon”, and its purpose is to introduce some technology or software toolkit to the attendees, and let then “play” and develop ideas around it.<br />
In this case the OpeNER project partners made an API available to users as a Web service. Users where capable of calling the different methods and work with the results, to develop small but original applications along the day.<br />
More than 50 people spent the day programming, interchanging ideas and, why not, having fun. It was a wonderful experience and a very nice time, as many messages in Twitter confirm.<br />
By the end of the day, almost 10 different original ideas were shown, and prices were given to the most voted ones. Congratulations to the winners!<br />
Some of these ideas were employed in the End User Advisory Board to illustrate the functionality of the OpeNER technology.<br />

<div><small>19 February 2013</small></div>
<p>Olery announced their participation in the OpeNER project in their recent press release.<br />
Here’s an excerpt from the press release:<br />
“The goal of the OpeNER project is to provide enterprise and society with base technologies for Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition and Classification and Sentiment Analysis that provide a generic multilingual sentiment lexicon with normalisation and scales of cultural differences, and an extension lexicon for the tourism sector. The initial target languages are Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, English and French. These technologies will enable companies in the industry to focus on its products rather than the core language resources.”
