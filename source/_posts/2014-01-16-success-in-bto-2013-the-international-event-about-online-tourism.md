The BTO event has been very successful, full of interesting conferences and discussions. We have seen a big enthusiasm to work on Tourism 2.0, as the example given by http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/it/ webpage: new booking system, free for 15000 companies of our database that can improve their offers and get more clients without increasing the prices.
