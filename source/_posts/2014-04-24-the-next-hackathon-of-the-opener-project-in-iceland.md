Come Hack with OpeNER: an event on 26th May 2014 in which computer programmers and others will have the opportunity to collaborate intensively on this software project.
Donâ€™t you think that this can be a great opportunity to collaborate in a very interesting project, learn more about software programming and visit Iceland?
