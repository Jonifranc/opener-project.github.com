The European Data Forum has taken place on March 19-20, 2014 in Athens, Greece
The OpeNER project members, Fabio Valsecchi and Andrea Dâ€™Errico have taken active part in the exhibition area presenting the results of the project.
The EDF is the annual meeting-point for data practitioners from industry, research, the public-sector and community initiatives, to discuss the opportunities and challenges of the emerging Data Economy in Europe.
The EDF 2014 comprises keynotes from global experts in the field, submitted presentations by participants, a panel and a 2-day exhibition. It concentrates on recent developments such as Open Data, Linked Data and Big Data and balances technical, application and socio-economic issues. The aim of the forum is to bring together all stakeholders involved in the data value chain to exchange ideas in order to strengthen the European data economy and its positioning worldwide. Discussions at EDF 2014 also provide input to research, development, and policy activities at the European Commission (e.g., Horizon 2020) and those of the EU member states, with the aim of influencing the development of the new European data economy.
