Olery announced their participation in the OpeNER project in their recent press release.
Here’s an excerpt from the press release:
“The goal of the OpeNER project is to provide enterprise and society with base technologies for Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition and Classification and Sentiment Analysis that provide a generic multilingual sentiment lexicon with normalisation and scales of cultural differences, and an extension lexicon for the tourism sector. The initial target languages are Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, English and French. These technologies will enable companies in the industry to focus on its products rather than the core language resources.”
