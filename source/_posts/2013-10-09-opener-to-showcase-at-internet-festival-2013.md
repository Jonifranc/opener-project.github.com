How long will it take computers to reach the language age? Understanding language is one of the most fascinating challenges to science, because it represents the keystone for real smart systems. OpeNER is willing to address this question and give a contribution to the progress of Language Technologies, participating at the Internet Festival 2013.
Carlo Aliprandi will give a talk during the Industrial Session of the Workshop “The language age”, presenting the state of the art for Sentiment Analysis.
