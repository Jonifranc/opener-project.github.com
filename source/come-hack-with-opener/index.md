The OpeNER team is delighted to present a Tutorial and a Hackathon together in a one-day workshop on multilingual Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Resolution using the OpeNER NLP pipelines as web services in the Cloud.

OpeNER hopes to repeat the success from the [July 2013 Amsterdam Hackathon](http://www.opener-project.org/2013/07/18/opener-hackathon-in-amsterdam/) in which a broad spectrum of real end user SMEs, Micro-SMEs, Freelancers and even a few from technology giants, built creative applications using the OpeNER webservices. For examples of the applications built follow the URL provided above.

We invite the NLP community, and beyond, to come and participate in the OpeNER Tutorial and Hackathon. The participants will be encouraged to use the NLP technologies and submit a paper as a result of their experiences. Moreover, during the workshop, the participants will be invited to form a team on the day to build a demo based on their wildest ideas. A winner will be voted on by their peers and go home with all the Kudos!

The participants are encouraged to bring their own datasets, their own computer and even their own natural language processors, visualisation tools, etc. if they wish to integrate them with the OpeNER pipelines. In the workshop website we will include all the information regarding the Hackathon organisation.

The only requirement for Participants in the Hackathon is a laptop with wifi connection.
