# OpeNER Demos.

A list of demos with a short explanation. Individual pages per demo for the
details.

## TourPedia
			
<a href="http://tour-pedia.org/gui/demo">TourPedia</a> is a Web application 
which shows users' sentiments about touristic locations of some of the most 
important cities and regions in Europe.  More specifically, TourPedia, exploits the OpeNER pipeline to analyse usersâ€™ reviews on places. All reviews are extracted from social media. 
Once analysed, each review is associated to a rate, which ranges from 0 to 100. 
The sentiment of each place is calculated as a function of all the sentiments of reviews on that place. 
As a result, TourPedia shows all the places and their users' sentiments on a map.

## OpeNER analysis demo

This is a demo that shows some of the OpeNER tools analysis results. The demo shows many views of the information contained in a KAF documents, like the named entities detected (people, locations, organizations, etc.), their links to DBpedia if any, the polarity of the words, etc. The demo does not cover all the OpeNER analysis modules but it is a quick way to see what OpeNER project is about.
