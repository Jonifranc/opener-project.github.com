# OpeNER Demos.

## TourPedia
			
<a href="http://tour-pedia.org/gui/demo">TourPedia</a> is a Web application 
which shows users' sentiments about touristic locations of some of the most 
important cities and regions in Europe.  More specifically, TourPedia, exploits the OpeNER pipeline to analyse usersâ€™ reviews on places. All reviews are extracted from social media. 
Once analysed, each review is associated to a rate, which ranges from 0 to 100. 
The sentiment of each place is calculated as a function of all the sentiments of reviews on that place. 
As a result, TourPedia shows all the places and their users' sentiments on a map.
