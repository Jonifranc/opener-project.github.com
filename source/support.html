                <p>Please don't hesitate to contact us by email at <a
                  href="mailto:info@olery.com">info@olery.com</a>. However, if
                you have problems with a specific component, you can also go to
                <a href="https://github.com/opener-project/">the Github
                  repository</a> of the component and create an issue in
                the issue tracker. </p>

                <h4 class="faq-head"> Can I use all of this for free?</h4>
                <p>Most of it, yes. We created a <a
                  href="/project/licenses.html">license overview </a> to
                indicate which components are free for all, and which components
                are only available for non-commercial or research use.</p>

                <h4 class="faq-head"> Can I adapt OpeNER for my own domain?</h4>

                  href="getting-started/how-to/domain-adaption.html">how to
                  adapt opener to your own domain</a> over at the gettings
