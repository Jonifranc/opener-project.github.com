# How to: Domain Adaption

## Aim: Adding a new Domain (DELUXE)

Fine-tuning the tools and pipeline in order to able to perform a opinion mining and named entity analysis on a new domain using trained modules

(1) collect texts
(2) send the text through the pipeline 
(3) annotate a selection of the text
(4) train the model using the annotations
(5) use a generic sentiment lexicon
(6) generate a domain-specific lexicon
(7) ??
