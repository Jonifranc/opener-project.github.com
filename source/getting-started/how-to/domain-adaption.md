# How to: Domain Adaption

## Aim: Adding a new Domain (DELUXE)

Fine-tuning the tools and pipeline in order to able to perform a opinion mining and named entity analysis on a new domain using trained modules

+ collect texts
+ send the text through the pipeline 
+ annotate a selection of the text
+ train the model using the annotations
+ use a generic sentiment lexicon
+ generate a domain-specific lexicon
+ ??

## Needed components
domain-specific text scraped (REF to wiki-scraper) or collected by the user 

###general language lexicons
a generic sentiment lexicons for the OpeNER languages can be found here (REF)
tools to generate generic sentiment lexicons can be found here (REF)
