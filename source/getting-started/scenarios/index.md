# Scenarios

OpeNER can be used in many different scenario's. Each scenario can use a mixed
selection of OpeNER components and components you built yourself. It might help
to think of an OpeNER scenario as a constructing a pipeline out of Lego-blocks
where each block (we call them components) performs a certain task that enriches
the text and analysis.

We currently have a description of several scenarios:

* [basic opinion detection](basic-opinions.html)
* [named-entity-disambiguation](named-entity-disambiguation.html)
* [full pipeline](full-pipeline.html)

And we have manuals available on:

* [how to create your own scenario](create-your-won-scenario.html)
