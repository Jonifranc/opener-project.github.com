<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Customer reviews and ratings on the Internet are increasing importance in the evaluation of products and services by potential customers. In certain sectors, it is even becoming a fundamental variable in the purchase decision. A recent Forrester study showed more than 30% of Internet users have evaluated products online, and that 70% of those studied end user generated reviews.
 
This trend will continue with the growth of Social Media and access to Information andCommunication Technologies (ICT). Consumers tend to trust the opinion of other consumers, especially those with prior experience of a product or service, rather than company marketing. The role of user comments is of particular importance when there is little differentiation between the product offers.
 
Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining are established, although nascent, fields of research, development and innovation. The goal is always broadly the same; to know “Who” is speaking about “What”, “When” and in “What sense”.
 
These factors have led to a burgeoning industry with a plethora of companies offering Sentiment Analysis services in Social Media. While most offer a generic service, in typically just one language, several companies have specialised offering services specific to tourism due to its bounded domain, demonstrable value, and the high level of adoption of Internet technologies by both suppliers and consumers.
 
 
It is also an application domain with limited scope and variation, and a high dependency on multilingual sentiment analysis and detection and classification of a wide range of common Named Entities.
 
Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) are important in determining roles. Once multilingualism and cultural skew are introduced, the complexity of the challenge increases manifold. OpeNER will create base technologies for Cross-lingual NERC and Sentiment Analysis that will enable industry users to both implement and contribute to a basic set of core technologies that all require and allow them to focus their efforts on providing tailored and innovative solutions at the rules and analysis levels.
 
The OpeNER project will provide a rich Named Entity Data Source in a simple, structured and standardised format. The Named Entity Detection will be capable of marking Named Entities in the same format irrespective of the text under analysis or the language of the text. The project will also provide linking modules that are capable of matching locally detected Named Entities with generic data.</p>



<h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
